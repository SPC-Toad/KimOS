# Kim OS
- Welcome to my personal Operating System
## *About*
- Created 12/29/24!
- This is where I learn and apply my OS knowledge 
- This is a long term project [ `never-ending project :)` ]
- I will make the readme(s) better by end of winter break. SORRY!
- If you want to know what I have learned during OS journey, check out the sys-lvl-notes in my github repo.

### Functionalities
#### Completed
1. GRUB 2 setup (old setup was using GRUB legacy --v 0.97)
2. memory mapping (using multiboot)
3. Context switching (FIFO with yield)
4. File system structure layout and initalizations



#### To do list
1. Fragmentation (modulizing all the work into header files)
2. Setup IDT (Interrupt descripter table)
3. Keyboard driver (requires IDT and IRQ 1 call)
4. Context switching (Round Robin by using PIT for time)
5. `Full` file system support
    - correct index node tracking (in bitmap)
    - Support single and double indirect pointers
6. So much more! hehehehheheheheheh
